### What I learned

I learn to make Responsive Designs and how to Style my html components
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <main>
    <section>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code image">
        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to <br> the next level</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  </main>
```
```css
 /* Phones */
    @media (min-width: 375px) {

      main {
        margin: 0;
        border-radius: 0;
      }

      .card {
        max-width: 90%;

      }

      .card img {
    
        max-width: 100%;
        border-radius: 10px;
        height: auto;
      }
    }
```

### Continued development

I would hope to continue learn CSS and Responsive Design which can help master skills that I can be able to use for more projects.


### Useful resources

- [Resoure 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9yI6fjkrfE) - This helped me understand responsive design. I really liked this pattern and will look for videos to master it going forward.
